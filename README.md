providing easy access of information to those who can benefit most

**Note : this is a work in progress**

Using a modified librarybox (librarybox.us) to provide access to  knowledge in the form of Books, lectures - audio and visual, applications with a special effort to include children and women.

most people in South Africa don't have computers at home, but do have smartphones or tablets that are wifi enabled. data is quite expensive, but leveraging of the wifi capable devices as well as the brilliant librarybox tech, a private network is created that can be accessed free of charge allowing content to be viewed and downloaded without a cost to the individual. running cost to the host is not excessive, using about the same amount of electricity used to charge a cellphone*

Although all beneficial information and knowledge can be considered islamic, the emphasis on islamic knowledge leads to a foot in the door technique whereby the server can be hosted in mosques - typically the focal point of many communities, and be accessable to all members of the community. The type of information is dependant on the community it wishes to serve and therefore the contents can be altered by the local admin (if there is an active member). otherwise generic content will be provided til a response or request is made.

no uploading is allowed in the initial phase, but that can be allowed once the server has a local admin in charge.
contact information is provided for any requests, complaints or submissions. local content is encouraged and welcomed noting that the owner is aware of the sharing nature and allows it for the benefit of the community.

The nature of the server is of a private online one and therefore monitoring of the server has to be done by physical presence. this provides many pros but also some cons. the cons will best be dealt with as a community and a "best practices" manual can be created and shared.

the are further plans to extend perhaps by forking this project to expand loftier goals with the help of others.
